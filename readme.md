#### Useful info 
- The elastic search part is based on this docker container:
    >https://elk-docker.readthedocs.io/

- We wanted to use this api to fetch videos
  but signature is generated by youtube people, so its brought with the youtube pages as is.
  currently we're using alternative way using [youtube-dl]
